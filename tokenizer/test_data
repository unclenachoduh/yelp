This is my 9 year olds review.     Hamburgers are great and the cheese curds are awesome.   There is a Great Lake View
Love going here during the summer.  Nice bar outside and great people and boat watching.  Went here for dinner last week and it was just Meh.  Food was bland an uninspired.  What the waitress offered as the special was not what was delivered.  After we asked, she still didn't know what was included with the dinner.  Walleye sandwich was just OK.  Service was on the slow side too; one server for the entire 2 floors.  The lady tried hard, so she earned a good tip.  The kitchen and management could do a lot better.  Probably will not go here again for dinner.  Too bad because we do like the place overall.
I was actually quite surprised at how good the fish fry was.  I had some great hashbrowns with it and my wife really enjoyed the salad that accompanied the meal.  If you're a craft beer lover like myself, you'll be disappointed in their beer selection, but Christy's is worth a visit solely for their fish fry.
Kushi bar will close at the end of August (may already be closed)\nhttp:\/\/77square.com\/food\/restaurants\/story_462727
I am infatuated with my new love, Muramoto. At first, I was highly doubtful the state of Wisconsin could feature decent sushi but boy oh boy was I wrong. Mad props incredibly for the fact that they feature a deeeelicious Philly role with salmon and cream cheese. Heavenly! I enjoy the fact that they serve their edamame with big grains of salt to give it an extra kick. And last but certainly not least, I could drink a million of the Russian teas (a smooth mixture of kahlua and green tea vodka, which I have never tried or seen before this restaurant introduced me to it!) \n\nI end my Valentine to Muramoto with a shout out to its modern decor that made me feel like I was in big city again, and that it smells like fresh sushi on the inside, since most Japanese restaurants don't smell like anything! This is the first place of many in Madison that I have graced with 5 stars because I was that impressed!
Our server was nice but sadly the food was just ok.\n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\n\nBone marrow: the bone marrow was good but the crostini that came with it was stale, old and chewy it was so hard to chew. We asked if it's suppose to be crunchy because most crostini are and the server says I honestly don't know ................ Well she went to go and ask the cook if they can make the crostini crunchy.... They did but she only came out with two pieces.... Reallllllyyyyy there's two of us and we have two big Bones with bone marrow... Well she At least she tried.\n\nButter chicken and halfsies: hmmm it's a wanna be chicken curry with undercooked soupy rice........\n\nPork belly Mac: the pork belly was good sadly the skin was soggy from the cheese sauce.. The pasta was over cooked. The idea of the dish was pretty cool though.\n\nSteak frites: if you want steak in your butter order this you'd love it!
i've been here a few times now. the beer list is pretty solid, but the bloody marys are just ok. the turkey sandwich is awesome (with gouda and apple-pear slaw, yum!), and they definitely get points for having poutine on the menu. i would come more often if it wasn't always packed to the gills.
Two of our very good friends, my husband, and I wanted a night out at a new Madison eatery.  It was a Sat. night without reservations.  Thankfully we found a spot at the bar and enjoyed a few beverages before dinner.  The bartender offered samples and suggestions to the various beers we were interested in.  My husband has Celiac, several options were present.  Yes, the variety and knowledge of beverages was exceptional but the food was lacking.  \nMy husband ordered the pork chop, it came out (too) rare and was sent back.  They comped us for this thankfully.  My girlfriend and I ordered the chicken curry dish.  The chicken was tender but extremely salty!  It was if they had brined the chicken over night.  The curry sauce was very comfort food yummy.  I know it's a European\/Canadian thing to have gravy covered fries but I'm not a fan.  Our friend ordered the mussels and loved them!  \nWe shared desserts of Creme Brulee - Delish!!!  and chocolate cheese cake (i think) - dry and blah\nNot a fan of the menu, or options (too few).  Like i read in previous reviews, i 'd go for drinks but not the food.
Great energy and really cool menu.\n\nThe salads were among the best we've had.   The choice of beers is almost overwhelming and there are also some good wines by the glass.\n\nThis restaurant was absolutely packed on a very cold Tuesday night when I worried it may be quiet - it was a very busy \/ good buzz \/ high energy - really liked it.
